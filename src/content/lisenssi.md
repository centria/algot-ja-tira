The course material relies heavily on the **Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit** book (only available in Finnish), by Antti Laaksonen. The book is available here: [**https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahslaaks/tirakirja/**](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahslaaks/tirakirja/). This course uses the spring 2020 edition. The book is used in University of Helsinki's course: [**https://tira-s19.mooc.fi/**](https://tira-s19.mooc.fi/), which is also an inspiration to this course.
